# Patient Admission Prediction Model using XGBOOST with a Prediction app

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model(ED prediction.ipynb) and a Streamlit web application designed to predict whether patients in an emergency department require admission or not. The model is built using common data available in the emergency department, and the Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface for users to input patient details and obtain real-time predictions.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Machine Learning Model Development:**
   - The machine learning model is trained to predict patient admission based on historical data.
   - Extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training techniques are applied to maximize prediction accuracy.
   - The model is serialized and saved for easy deployment.

2. **Streamlit Web Application:**
   - A user-friendly Streamlit web app is created to serve as the user interface.
   - Users can input patient details, including age, gender, and medical information.
   - The app sends user data to the deployed model to obtain predictions, which are presented in a user-friendly format.

## Model Deployment

The model deployment process involves the following steps:

1. **Model Serialization:**
   - The trained machine learning model is serialized using a library like `joblib` or `pickle`.
   - Serialization ensures that the model can be easily loaded and used for predictions within the Streamlit app.

2. **Dockerization:**
   - The project is containerized using Docker to simplify deployment and ensure consistent runtime environments.
   - A `Dockerfile` is provided, specifying the environment and dependencies for running the application.

3. **Cloud Deployment:**
   - The Docker container can be deployed to a cloud platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
   - Cloud hosting offers scalability and accessibility.

## Running the Application

To run the Streamlit application locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system.

2. Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`:
   ```bash
   docker build -t patient-admission-app .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8501:8501 patient-admission-app
Access the Streamlit app in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python libraries and tools:

scikit-learn for machine learning model development.
streamlit for creating the web application.
joblib for serializing the machine learning model.
Docker for containerization and deployment.
Future Enhancements
Opportunities for further project development include:

Continuous model updates with new data to maintain prediction accuracy.
Improved user interface and interactivity in the Streamlit app.
Implementation of security measures for user data protection.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the successful development and deployment of a patient admission prediction model, complemented by an easy-to-use Streamlit app. Together, machine learning and web development efforts have the potential to significantly impact healthcare operations, reducing costs and enhancing patient care.
